## TL;DR

- A bookclub for reading [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://a.co/d/8QTDDFc) by the one and only [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/).
- The club will read a chapter a week and also meet weekly to discuss each chapter's content.
- The weekly sessions will be livestreamed on the dedicated YouTube channel ([@mlopslearners](https://www.youtube.com/@mlopslearners))

## Goal for this book club

The ultimate goal for this reading club is to read the book Designing Machine
Learning Systems in its entirety. By doing so, we will have learned a great deal
about how to construct robust, performant, and scalable machine learning solutions
to real world problems.

A not-so-distant secondary goal of this book club is to socialize; that is to
meet new people, learn together, and have lots of fun while doing so! Meet people
who enjoy learning and building, and the hope is that we can continue collaborating
even after the completion of this bookclub (yes, sadly all good things must come
to an end).

## How this works?

For the next 3 months, we’ll be reading Designing Machine Learning Systems together
(a chapter/week).

### Weekly reading

A book/paper club only works if everyone reads the material. The expectation is
that everyone will read the chapter of the week before the group discussion so
that we can all contribute to the conversation.

Everyone is encouraged to post their reading progress and questions on the main
bookclub channel.
